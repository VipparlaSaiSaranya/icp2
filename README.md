Basically in this ICP, we have created an html file (extension with .html) and named it as index.html 
In this html file we have used several tags like 
Paragraph tag: It usually represents paragraph. It adds margin automatically to the content inside those tags. Before and after the paragraph it add a break/new line. 

Heading tag: Heading tag is generally used to represent headings. We have h1 to h6 being h1 is the largest size to h6 is the smallest.

List: In list we have 2 types
1. Ordered List: We will have the order of the list - to control the sequence of the order.
2. Unordered List: we will have unorder list of the items or it can be bulleted list. 

Div Element: Div tag will be used for a division or a section.

Span Tag: This Span tag can be used for group of elements.
The difference between div and span tag is 
div is a block level element and span is an inline element.

Block: Block elements starts on a new line and 
Span: Span element can start on anywhere on a line.

We have displayed an image and used anchor tag to redirect to the location of the image.
We have also displayed a YouTube video on the html page and also we can control the video like play, pause, maximize and minimize.
We have used css tags as well in the html page. Basically, css can be used in 3 ways:
1. Inline CSS: css mentioned at each tag
2. Embedded CSS: all the CSS mentioned at one part of page
3. External CSS: CSS mentioned in external file with extension .css
